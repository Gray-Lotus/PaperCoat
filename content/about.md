## Greeting

Hello Everyone,

This page is just clarifying some information about the blog and myself.

## Who am I?

Not really anyone, I just read these books and always wanted to catalog them in one place and share them with other people.

## Rating System?

Why don't I use a numbered rating system? Honestly, because I just wanted to do the reviews based on feel rather than actual numbers. I also wasn't sure of a criteria strucuture so I didn't feel like making one.

### Reading Status

- Reading: Currently reading
- Dropped: I dropped the novel
- Finished: means I finished the novel
- On-Hold: decided to come back to (could be any reason like no raw or waiting for chapters to build up)

### Rating

Good > Alright > Mid > Eh > Bad

### Preferences

I Liked it vs Neutral vs I Disliked it
