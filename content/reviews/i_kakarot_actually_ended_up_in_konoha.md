## Synopsis:

Someone is reincarnated into the Dragon Ball world and is sent to the Naruto world because of an accident when being shot at by Freiza and her troops. The MC is fairly strong, as he is a Saiyan, but not that strong and soon that becomes more apparent.

## Review:

> {{< collapse summary= "Spoiler" >}}

Honestly, I liked the book because it was fun reading about someone as a Saiyan being in the Naruto world. It was cool to see that he could still use chakra because chakra is just physical energy and spiritual energy, and as the Dragon Ball world has magic it shouldn't be crazy that he can use chakra. The book is only alright though because it seems the dragon ball world is about to bleed into the main world and the MC is clearly not strong enough to deal with these enemies. The annoying thing is only the MC can deal with these enemies because the Naruto world on its base level is weak. So now he is gonna be a savior in the background. This is happening because Bulma and the gang wished to save earth from Freiza, so Shenron decides to weaken the time-space barrier between the two world assuming that Goku could save them. I guess Shenron is strong enough to look through time and see alternative timelines but not beat Freiza. What an annoying plot.
