## Synopsis:

Mc gets transmigrated into the Paldia region of the pokemon world. He becomes a rancher and raises quite a lot of pokemon. The ranch experience is not the struggles of being a rancher, rather the free spiritedness of it because food grows pretty easily in this world. Thus, it's quite a lighthearted novel.

## Review:

> {{< collapse summary= "Spoiler" >}}

I like it for what is it. A person gets put into the pokemon world and he rasises pokemon on a ranch. His cheat is a cooking ability, so if he cooks food he can give them certain buffs, plays a fun role in the story. We have some interesting plots from him having a Koraidon with a whole backstory behind it. We also have some interactions with Giratina and mew. He also finds a way to get the king of plenty from the galar region to come to his ranch.  Overall, its a very light hearted novel with a farely interesting plot behind it.
