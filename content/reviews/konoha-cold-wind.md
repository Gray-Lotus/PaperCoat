## Review:

> {{< collapse summary= "Spoiler" >}}

I honestly read this book a while ago but I do roughly remember how the story goes. It was a fun novel where you have this main character getting stronger in a not serious. But, at the end of the day, he does just use his system the entire time, making the novel roughly uninspiring. However, he does extract abilities from some interesting characters, like that guy who used the zero tails and the [body revival technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Revival_Technique). Therefore, for me the novel is like popcorn to pass the time.
